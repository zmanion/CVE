# 1 Introduction

## 1.1 Background

The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) Program is a voluntary, international, community-driven effort to identify, define, catalog, and share information about Publicly Disclosed cybersecurity Vulnerabilities. A CVE Identifier (CVE ID) and corresponding CVE Record enable multiple parties to discuss and share information with confidence that they are referencing the appropriate Vulnerability. This Vulnerability identification capability is fundamental to global Vulnerability management.

Within the CVE Program, a CVE Numbering Authority (CNA) is an organization authorized to assign CVE IDs and publish CVE Records, ideally as part of the initial Public Disclosure of a Vulnerability. Benefits of participating in the CVE Program as a CNA include the ability to Publicly Disclose Vulnerabilities with pre-assigned CVE IDs and the first opportunity to assign CVE IDs for Vulnerabilities within the CNAâ€™s Scope Definition. In addition to assigning CVE IDs, CNAs also create and publish information about the identified Vulnerability in its associated CVE Record.

Many CNAs are Suppliers who assign CVE IDs to and publish CVE Records for Vulnerabilities affecting Products owned, developed, or maintained by the Supplier. Examples of CNAs include:

 * Software and hardware Suppliers, including product security incident response teams (PSIRTs)
 * Open source software projects, maintainers, and foundations
 * Service providers
 * Vulnerability researchers
 * National computer security incident response teams (CSIRTs)
 * Vulnerability coordinators
 * Vulnerability databases
 * Bug bounty providers

## 1.2 Adherence to CVE Program Policies and Rules

To participate in the CVE Program, CNAs:

1.2.1 MUST agree and adhere to program policies, guidance, responsibilities, and rules, which are listed in the Rules & Policies section of the Resources page, and

1.2.2 MUST operate under the CVE Terms of Use License, and

1.2.3 MUST comply with the CNA Operational Rules defined in this document.

1.2.3.1 Serious or repeated failure to adhere to these rules MUST be reviewed by an appropriate Root. The CVE Board MAY revoke CNA status.

1.2.3.2 An appropriate Root MUST notify a CNA of any infractions that initiate a review.
